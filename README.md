## Description ‚úàÔ∏è
This project is a boilerplate for creating API projects in Go, incorporating key principles of Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture. It reflects my expertise in Golang, drawn from previous projects, and is structured to facilitate maintainability and scalability.

All layers of the codebase are tested to ensure reliability and robustness. The project is open to contributions and improvements. Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues to discuss enhancements or report bugs.
  
### Project architecture:
<div align="center">

</div>

For the presentation layer, which I refer to as the transport layer, its purpose is to handle data transportation. It is responsible for receiving and responding to various types of requests, including API calls, gRPC, and messaging via RMQ, among others.

##  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started üíª

### Prerequisites ‚ùó
* Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.
* Modify the entrypoint file permissions with the command `chmod +x .docker/entrypoint.sh`.
* An installation of Go 1.18 or later. For installation instructions, see [Installing Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### Launching the Application  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
To start the application, execute the command `docker-compose up`. Once you see the message `your server started on [::]:5000`, the application is up and running!

### üìù API Documentation:
For detailed API endpoint documentation, navigate to the `/docs` directory where you will find the Swagger documentation.
