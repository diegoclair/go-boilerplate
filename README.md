## üìù Project
Go Boilerplate/Template for API projects
  
## Description ‚úàÔ∏è
Here I tried to create an golang boilerplate with experiences that I got with doing some projects using Go.
I tried to use concepts from DDD, Clean Arch and some design patterns. 
  
The code are with all layers tested.
Feel free to help me improve the project/structure. 
  
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start application üíª 

### ‚ùó First of all:
* You need to have docker installed in your computer.
* Run the command `chmod +x .docker/entrypoint.sh` to give permissions to execute the entrypoint file.

### Start ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
To start the applciation, you need just to run the command `docker-compose up`. When you see this message `your server started on [::]:5000` so your app is running correctly!

### üìù Docs:
Inside of the `/docs` folder, you can see the Swagger documentation of the API Endpoints.
